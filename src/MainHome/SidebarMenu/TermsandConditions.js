<div className="divider" />

<h4> DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>
        <p>
        VALAM operates a technology platform designed to empower authorized users within specific 
locations in the United States. This platform enables users to perform various actions, including 
locating, hailing, booking, and hiring third-party providers offering ground transportation services 
through taxicabs or other for-hire vehicles (referred to as "Taxis"). Users can also pay for Taxi rides, 
track specific rides and payments, all through a supported computing device. This comprehensive 
offering, inclusive of mobile device software applications (such as the ValamÂ® Application), text-based 
messaging protocols (referred to as "Text Services"), Valam-authorized web interfaces or websites 
(such as <a href="http://valam.net">http://valam.net</a>), and other means authorized by VALAM (collectively referred to as 
"Channels"), constitutes the "Service." Certain Channels allow users to store payment information, set 
tip preferences, and review past trips and receipts.
It is important to note that VALAM is not an issuer, financial institution, or money transmission 
business. Additionally, VALAM does not provide transportation services, own or operate Taxis, or exert 
control over Taxi owners, managers, dispatchers, agents, drivers, and operators. Through the Service, 
VALAM solely acts as a platform to facilitate the acquisition of third-party transportation services and 
the payment of fares associated with these services.
</p>

<div className="divider" />

<h4>REGISTRATION</h4>
        <p>In order to utilize the Service, you must initially create and register an account on the form, referred 
to as an "Account." This can be done through an Application, a Website, or another Channel that offers 
such functionality. When registering an Account, you affirm that you have the legal capacity to enter 
into a binding agreement and assert that all information provided during registration or through the 
Application, Website, or other Channel is truthful, complete, and accurate. The registration process 
involves: 
<ol>
    <li>associating an email address (which becomes your username) and creating a password 
for your Account;</li>
    <li> associating a phone number capable of receiving text messages with your 
Account; and </li>
    <li>submitting one or more valid credit cards for processing payment transactions 
associated with Taxi rides booked, hired, arranged, or paid for through the Service.</li>
</ol>
   For each registered 
credit card, debit card, or other accepted payment card, you authorize VALAM to verify the card's 
good standing with the issuer, which may include requesting payment authorization or processing a 
low-dollar amount credit in accordance with applicable card network rules.</p>

<div className="divider" />

<h4>ACCOUNT</h4>
<p>
You bear the exclusive responsibility for safeguarding the confidentiality and security of your Account 
password, as well as for all activities occurring through your Account. You commit to promptly 
notifying VALAM if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account or unauthorized access to your 
password. VALAM holds no responsibility for any losses incurred due to the unauthorized use of your 
Account.
Moreover, you are accountable for furnishing and maintaining current, truthful, complete, and 
accurate information for your Account throughout your use of the Service. VALAM reserves the right 
to periodically assess your registration, Account, and eligibility to continue utilizing the Service, and 
may request additional information as needed. VALAM, at its sole and absolute discretion, retains the 
right to reject, suspend, or terminate your Account, with or without notice, except as otherwise

</p>

<div className="divider" />

<h4>PROCESSING PAYMENTS FOR THE SERVICE AND TAXI RIDES</h4>
<p>
When you utilize the Service to hail, book, hire, arrange, or pay for a Taxi ride, you are considered to 
have accepted the service provided by VALAM through the Service and agree to pay the corresponding 
fees or charges (refer to Service Fees below). Upon requesting a Taxi ride through the Service, we may 
pre-authorize one of the payment cards linked to your account for an amount that reasonably ensures 
your ability to cover the fare and associated fees or charges for the requested Taxi ride. Upon entering 
a Taxi and instructing the driver or operator to a destination, you are considered to have accepted the 
third-party transportation services and agree to pay the corresponding fare and related fees or 
charges (such as tolls, sales tax, regulatory surcharges, etc.). These amounts, along with applicable 
Service Fees, will be charged to one of the payment cards associated with your account, and you 
hereby authorize such charges. Payments made in connection with the Taxi rides you hire, book, 
arrange, or pay for through the Service are non-refundable by VALAM; however, you may have 
additional refund or charge-back rights as per the agreement with your card issuer. Please refer to the 
terms and conditions of your payment card for more information.
</p>

<div className="divider" />

<h4>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE</h4>
<p>
Your use of the Service is strictly for personal use, limited to facilitating the hailing, booking, hiring, 
and payments for Taxi rides in specific locations within the United States. It may not be utilized for 
sending cash advances, cash equivalents, or transferring money between you and a third party.
By accessing or using the Service, you agree to use it, including all associated features, functionalities, 
Channels, and software, in accordance with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws, statutes, 
rules, and regulations (referred to as "Applicable Laws"). Furthermore, you commit to:
Use the Service only for lawful purposes.
Avoid uploading, posting, emailing, or transmitting any material containing software viruses or any 
other computer code, files, or programs designed to disrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of the

<h4>SERVICE FEES</h4>
<p>
For each Taxi ride initiated through the Service by making a ground transportation request, you may 
incur a base service fee. In accordance with this provision, you agree to pay the specified amount to 
VALAM and authorize VALAM to charge it to a payment card linked to your Account.
Reservation Fee: If you choose to schedule a Taxi ride in advance (a "Scheduled Booking") through the 
Service, you may be subject to an additional reservation fee for each resulting Taxi ride. You agree to 
pay this fee to VALAM and authorize the corresponding charge to a payment card associated with your 
Account. It's important to note that a reservation fee does not apply to immediate ground 
transportation requests. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that a Scheduled Booking does not 
guarantee a Taxi ride, and VALAM makes no representation or warranty regarding the availability of a 
third-party ground transportation provider at the time of your Scheduled Booking.
Cancellation Fee: Should you cancel a Taxi request via the Service after it has been accepted by a Taxi 
operator or cancel a Scheduled Booking less than sixty (10) minutes before the scheduled pick-up time, 
you may be subject to a cancellation fee. In such cases, you agree to pay the designated amount to 
VALAM and authorize the charge to a payment card associated with your Account.
No-Show Fee: If you request a Taxi through the Service and fail to cancel the request, the waiting time 
for the Taxi operator at the designated pickup location is four (4) minutes. For Scheduled Bookings, 
the Taxi operator will arrive within five (5) minutes of the scheduled pickup time and wait at least 
eight (8) minutes after the scheduled pickup time. Failure to board the Taxi within the applicable wait 
time may result in a no-show fee. You agree to pay this fee to VALAM and authorize the charge to a 
payment card associated with your Account.

finally and exclusively settled by confidential arbitration held in new Jersey. If $100,000 or less is at 
issue in the arbitration petition and/or response, then such arbitration shall be by one (1) independent 
arbitrator selected jointly by you and VALAM that arbitrator shall not have the power to issue an 
award in excess of $100,000. If more than $100,000 is at issue in the arbitration petition and/or 
response, then such arbitration shall be by three (3) independent arbitrators, one chosen by you, one 
chosen by VALAM, and the third chosen by the two arbitrators selected by the parties. Once appointed 
pursuant to either procedure, the arbitrator or arbitral tribunal may order provisional or conservatory 
measures (including injunctive relief) at the request of a party and may embody such order in any final 
award. Nothing in the foregoing precludes, restricts or is intended to preclude or restrict the right of 
either party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in an appropriate court of competent 
jurisdiction. English shall be the official language of the arbitration proceedings. Neither VALAM nor 
you will be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or 
entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general 
capacity. Procedures do not and shall not apply to any arbitration between or among you, Valam
and/or any Valam Indemnitees. The arbitrator or arbitral tribunal shall make a decision that is in 
accordance with these Terms of Service, shall apply the law of the State of New Jersey, without regard 
to its conflicts of laws principles, and shall state the basis for any decision in writing. Judgment upon 
the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to 
such court for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement as the case may be.

Waiver of Right to Jury Trial

Further to the arbitration provision above, with respect to any dispute, claim, action, or proceeding arising from or in connection with these Terms of Service or the service, you expressly and irrevocably waive any right you may have to a trial by jury and consent to arbitration as set forth in the foregoing arbitration provision.

extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation concerning the App Store 
Sourced Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses arising from 
a failure to meet any warranty will be VALAMâs sole responsibility.

<p>
You and VALAM acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or a third

Application against you as a third-party beneficiary.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and VALAM, outlining the full

unenforceable under Applicable Law, it will be modified and interpreted to fulfil the objective to the 
greatest extent possible under Applicable Law, and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid 
and effective. These Terms of Service, along with any granted rights and licenses, cannot be 
transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of VALAM. VALAM retains the right 
to assign or transfer these Terms of Service or any right or obligation under them to any third party 
without notice or consent. Notwithstanding the above, these Terms of Service shall be binding upon 
and advantageous to the parties involved, including their successors and permitted assigns.
